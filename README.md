# Website README

This website named "idk" features a simple design with a dark theme and interactive cursor movement. The main components of the website are:

- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the website, including a rounded rectangle with the title "Brady's Website" and a circular cursor element.
- `style.css`: Defines the styling of the elements on the website, including color themes, fonts, and positioning.
- `mousefollow.js`: Implements the cursor animation logic based on mouse movement, including translation, scaling, and rotation effects.

Feel free to explore the website and interact with the dynamic cursor behavior!
